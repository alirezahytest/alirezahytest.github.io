The number one fear of most people is speaking in public. This article introduces some ways to improve your speaking ability, as well as to overcome the fear of speaking to a group.

## one
Whether for an audience of 50 or an audience of 1, fear and embarrassment about speaking to people can be controlled. Public speaking is a skill that everyone can learn with practice. Learn how to speak with confidence, and make your presentation interesting by using the communication power tools below.

## 2, Eye Contact
Good eye contact helps your audience feel more relaxed and builds confidence in your speaking ability. Keep eye contact by knowing your speech so well that you need to have a quick look at your notes only from time to time. • Find a few friendly faces in the audience that react to your message and concentrate on giving your speech to them. Keep eye contact for four to five seconds at a time, and then move to someone else.

## 3, Stance and Body Movements
Good posture shows confidence. Stand firmly. Too much movement can be distracting to your listeners. • You normally hold your arms along your sides. To emphasize main points, you’ll want to use movements that are slow and careful but look natural. • Be aware of habits you might have like crossing your arms, leaning against a wall, or tapping a pen. This might also be distracting to your audience or might tell them that you are uninterested or unconfident. • Practice your speech in front of a mirror to check your way of presentation and body movements and change them if necessary. Try many different ways to find a comfortable balance of gestures to use in front of an audience.

## 4, Facial Expressions 
Friendly facial expressions help to build a warm and positive relationship with your audience. A smile on your face lets them know that you are human and trustworthy, giving them more reasons to accept your ideas. • Expressions on your face show the mood of your speech and keep the audience involved.

## 5, Suitable Dress
Good choice of clothes helps you have respect for your audience. Before you arrive to give your presentation, ask others for their opinion on your choice of clothing and how suitable it is for the occasion.

## 6, Voice Projection
Sometimes tone of voice can have a stronger effect than the message. Put feeling and energy into your voice by practicing. You can add variety to your speech by: • raising or lowering your voice, • changing the speed of your words to make the audience feel excited, • using pauses and silences instead of saying ‘uh’, ‘umm’, and ‘you know’, • increasing and decreasing the volume of your voice to emphasize main points and involving the listeners, • adding energy so that your voice will never be boring or emotionless, and • practicing every day and recording your voice to see where changes may be necessary.

## 7, Audience Involvement
Involve your audience by asking questions, talking to them directly, and getting them interested. This helps build a relaxed relationship with your audience. • Involve the audience by using attractive opening sentences, pictures, maps, pieces of films, or by asking for help from the audience.

## 8, Sense of Humor 
The purpose of humor is not to be a comedian but for you to create a comfortable atmosphere and have fun with your audience. Humor can make the difference between an average and an excellent presentation. • A little humor in your speech lets the audience know you are human and people actually learn more if they are having fun. Try to include personal stories or recent events to add fun to your speech.

## 9, Controlling Nervousness
Most people are afraid of speaking in public. They fear this even more than death. Everyone has a certain amount of nervousness when talking to a group, but the point is not to end nervousness; learn to control it. • Just before your speech do some deep breathing exercises to relax. • Use your nervousness to add excitement to your speech. • Remember you were asked to talk because you had something important to say. • Everyone wants you to succeed.

## Ten
Speaking in public is a skill you can learn with practice. Controlling your fear and practicing the above skills in public speaking can bring you success.
