Whenever we're talking about user interfaces or user experience, an important part always arises: **What color?**
![Tag Colors](https://alireza.one/images/tagcolors.png "Tag Colors")

Colors are first things we see from the moment we born, all stuff we communicate with visually are colored even if they're black and white. The main reason colors are important to us is they have feelings. They express our emotions and personality.

Have you ever noticed we always paint lighting Yellow, we always paint woods Brown? It's inherent. From the first moment we saw trees our memory saved it Green. From the first moment we saw Facebook, it was Blue, our memory saved it Blue. Before writing this post, i asked several people about colors they see everyday in WWWW and i got interesting answeres.

Colors express our feelings, we even make idioms over them, We're depressed or sad: Feeling Blue. We scream loud and stressful: Violet. Colors are so involved in our sociteties.

## What is the philosophy?

>It seems almost a truism to say that color is a sensation; and yet Young, by honestly recognizing this elementary truth, established the first consistent theory of color. (Maxwell 1890/1970, p. 75)

According to [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/color) about colors (First published Mon Dec 1, 1997) colors are of philosophical interest for a number of reasons. In this post, I don't wanna write about why colors are philosophical, I wanna write about how colors express feelings and what are those feelings.
