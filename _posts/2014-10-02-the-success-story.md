Denver airport resolves baggage handling system problems by adding the InTouch(R) HMI for supervisory control

This is success story.


Denver, CO __ despite the huge size of Denver international airport (DIA), baggage handling is no problem and it’s not just because of the good-luck “suitcase-gargoyle” that overlooks the main terminal from atop a high pedestal. it;s do to a new supervisory control and automated trouble response system installed by contractor BAE automated system, inc (BAE) of Dallas, TX.


the solution was developed using the InTouch (R) human-machine interface(HMI) module from the factory suite(R) automaton software .tool developed by wonder ware, a businesses unit of Invensys , inc


After more than a year’s worth of construction delays and baggage-handling problems, Denver international opened business on February 28, 1995, as a replacement for the much smaller Stapleton Airport facility across town. as the gateway to the Rock Muntains, DIA had a great first year and was ranked tenth among the busiest Airport, with about 33 million passengers traveling trough the terminal.


As a hub for major national, international and regional airlines, DIA was designed with a main terminal building for passenger entry and exit, and three massive concourses to facilitate airplane docking, luggage loading and unloading and passengers bording. since DIA handles and average of 120,000 pieces of baggage per day, getting suitcases, skis, golf, clubs and other unusual pieces of luggage from the check-in counters to the planes and from the planes to the baggage claim areas in a reasonable amount of time is major of challenge. When DIA was designed,the City of Denver realized that,because of line distances between the terminal and the three concourses,they needed a very efficient system to get passengers’ bags to and from the planes quickly. they wanted to allow passengers to arrive at the airport within a comfortable time windows before the flight, yet they had to be able to move bags to airplanes quickly so that late arrives could be accommodated. when the original automated system encountered problems the city put in a mix of conveyor and the carousel equipment whose operation was automated using different programmable logic controls (PLCs). BEA resolved the problems whit this alternative systems by using the InTouch HMI as common user interface to bring the disparate types of equipment together as one system. ONE SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLE AIRLINES the airline services DIA decided that it would be more efficient and cost-effective to have an outside contractor maintain the baggage handling system than for each of them to do so themselves, so they selected BAE to maintain the system for both inbound and outbound traffic. it consist of 12 annunciation panels, four in each of three modules. each panel contains a schematic of its portion of the system, with alarms and indicator lights positioned at strategic locations to assist maintenance staff with troubleshooting.


if a bag were to jam in the system, an alarm would sound and and the appropriate indicator light would be illuminated to show where the problem was located. the baggage system is controlled by Allen Bradley PLCs outbound from the ticket counters to the airplanes and square D PLCs inbound from the airplanes to the baggage claim areas. the outbound system is fed by bth the ticket counters and curbside check-in areas and each bag’s luggage tag is printed with a bar code for its destination airport. as the bags come down the conveyors, a laser sorting system reads the tag bar code, sorts the bags by flight number and destination, then routes them to the appropriate carousel or make-up unit where ramp personnel place them into cards and drive them out to the airplanes. in the inbound system, the baggage carts come into the garage area from the ramps where the airplanes have been unload
